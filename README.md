Why should one choose an GNU General Public License (GPL.V3) license over other licenses?

Reason why I choose an GPL.V3 license was because it  allows for other people to use my code in my repository in both commerical and non-commericla use. This includes giving full rights to distribute and modify the code I have created. One restirction is that it does not allow anyone with a more restrictive license than mine to modify and distibute my code. 
I chose this as I believe in open source and want to give freedom for others to use my code as they would like. A main reason I started a Ph.D. was because I want to contribute as much back into the community in any ways that I can. 
What would have happened if no license was chosen?
If I didnt not to choose a license, then the deafault copyright laws would automatically apply. Which would mean that no one would be able to legally use, distribute, copy, or even modify my code without my persmission. This would be the opposite of my intent since I want to foster collaboration and open source.
